\subsection{Problem Background}
The earth's carbon circle is the foundation and important part of life on the planet. The decomposition of mixture is included in the carbon circle on the earth, allowing regeneration and reuse of carbon.
\par
Fungi play a key role in the earth's carbon circle, especially in the decomposition process of ground litter and woody fibers. There are two main and important traits of a fungus. One is \textbf{the growth rate of the fungus}, and the other is \textbf{the fungal tolerance to moisture}. These two characteristics are prime focuses on fungi of this article.
\par
According to a recent research~\cite{researchonfungi} on fungi, there is a conclusion that the slow growing strains of fungi tend to be better able to survive and grow in the presence of environmental changes with respect to moisture and temperature, while the faster growing strains tend to be less robust to the same changes.
