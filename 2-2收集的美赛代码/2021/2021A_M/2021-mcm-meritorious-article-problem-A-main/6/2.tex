\subsection{Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $F_A$, $F_B$, $F_C$, $F_D$, and $F_E$ are all virtual fungal species based on the analysis of problem sheet. Whether the corresponding species actually exists in the nature, remains to be studied.
  \item When modeling and analyzing the interactions within the fungal species combination, we only analyzed the combinations of two fungal species.
  \item Logistic model is generally used to model changes in common animals and plants populations. When it is applied to the study of microorganisms (fungi), we are uncertain about the validity of the results.
