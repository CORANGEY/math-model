\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Using Gaussian surface and Gauss theorem in physical electromagnetism, we deduce the process of fungi wood decomposition in accordance with objective laws and mathematical logic.
  \item Based on \textit{Figure~1} and \textit{Figure~2} given in problem sheet, after performing the function fitting derivation, we carry out the fungi selection operation, which simplifies the overall model building process, and obtains more practical data.
  \item Starting from Single-group Logistic Model, we use Multi-groups Logistic Model to accurately and comprehensively describe the interactions between different species of fungi.
  \item In the case of insufficient time series data, we use the Gray Prediction Model to predict and analyze the survival of fungal species combination and the change trend of decomposition in different environmental conditions.
  \item From the perspective of the ecosystem, we carry out an ecologically significant analysis of the impact of fungal population biodiversity on the carbon cycle in authentic nature.
