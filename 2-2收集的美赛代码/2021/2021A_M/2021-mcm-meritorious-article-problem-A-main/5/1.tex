\subsection{Analysis of Rapid Environmental Fluctuations}
In this article, to analyze the interaction of the mixed growth of multiple fungi, we establish Multi-groups Logistic Model. However, we do not make a detailed analysis of the environmental changes. Hence, we are going to examine the sensitivity of our model to rapid fluctuations in the environment.

In the real natural environment, disasters that are not conducive to the survival and reproduction of living things happen from time to time. When a disaster occurs, the natural environment fluctuates rapidly, and the survival of organisms in the area is threatened and restricted. Combining our model and the characteristics of fungi, we find that when the environment fluctuates rapidly, the inherent growth rate of fungi will change rapidly in a short time. Meanwhile, the natural maximum capacity of fungi will be reduced accordingly.
